# ðŸ’Ž Gutenberg Sketch File

## Updates ðŸ”¨

This is a fork of the [Automattic Gutenberg Sketch File](https://github.com/Automattic/gutenberg-themes-sketch). It hadn't been updated in a few months, and Sketch 52 is out with [a slew of new features](https://blog.sketchapp.com/dark-mode-data-a-brand-new-look-and-more-in-sketch-52-e462c8a64d00), so I figured an update was in order. In short:

- Layer/type styles in symbols (overrides colors, fonts) *new in Sketch 52*
- Updated naming conventions (for grouping/nesting)
- Resizing options fixed (responsive symbols)
- Type system rework (face, scaling)
- Added outline button
- Goofy artwork (from Vecteezy)
- Color scheme in place (with named styles: primary, dark, highlight, etc)
- Image/color shade (overlay color/image in cover, pullquote)

## GIFs ðŸŽ¬

**Nested symbol names** make it easier to find what you need

Note: works with the new Sketch 52 Data feature to pick images

**Sizing modes** for easy responsive tweaks

## Summary

*This is a slightly tweaked version of the original readme.*

This repository hosts a [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) file that is built to help you design WordPress themes with the block-based [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/) editor in mind.

The symbols in this file allows you to easily edit and customize styles for all of the default Gutenberg blocks. This makes it easy to iterate on styling blocks for themes, and can help you design in a more modular way. 

There's an [introductory post on Themeshaper](https://themeshaper.com/2018/03/07/designing-gutenberg-block-driven-themes-with-sketch/) that shows one example of a workflow, but we encourage you to experiment and share what works for you.

PRs and enhancements welcome!
